<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Senior undergraduate at Shandong University, based in Qingdao.

I am now working on Generative models(T2I, T2M), XAI research. If you would like to have an academic discussion or cooperation, please feel free to email me at chatoncws@gmail.com.

My research interests include:

- Text-to-Motion Generation
- Multimodal reasoning and generation
- XAI

[**Code**](https://github.com/sato-team/Stable-Text-to-Motion-Framework) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- **We are  the first work to discover the instability issue in text-to-motion models**
- We successfully strike a balance between accuracy and stability, ensuring our model maintains high precision even in the face of perturbations
- Our work points to a novel direction for improving text-tomotion models, paving the way for the development of more robust models for real-world applications

Lijie Hu#, Songning Lai#, **Wenshuo Chen#**, Hongru Xiao, Hongbin Lin, Lu Yu, Jingfeng Zhang, and Di Wang
- We proposed an end-to-end framework called Med-MICN, which leverages the strength of different XAI methods such as concept-based models, neural symbolic methods, saliency maps, and concept semantics.
- Our outputs are interpreted in multiple dimensions, including concept prediction, saliency maps, and concept reasoning rules, making it easier for experts to identify and correct errors.
- Med-MICN demonstrates superior performance and interpretability compared with other concept-based models and the black-box model baselines.

With Consistency Loss](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.18232)**
  
**Wenshuo Chen#**, Haozhe Jia#, Songning Lai, Keming Wu, Hongru Xiao, Lijie Hu, Yutao Yue
- Distinguished from previous works that primarily focused on temporal aspects, We introduce a novel research perspective by analyzing motion generation
from a denoising process.
- We propose two types of consistency loss that act on the semantic planning and fine-grained improving stages, significantly improving model stability and precision.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without increasing model complexity, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, thereby facilitating practical applications in text-tomotion generation.

- Unlike traditional data-driven methods, we incorporate Helmholtz equation-based constraints directly into the AI model, ensuring predictions align with electromagnetic wave propagation laws and reducing bias.
- Our approach leverages a dual U-Net architecture, where the first U-Net is trained via Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to enforce physical consistency, while the second U-Net 
- Extensive experiments on static (SRM) and dynamic (DRM) radio spectrum modeling validate the effectiveness of our method. Without increasing model complexity, our RMDM framework outperforms existing solutions, offering a robust and practical approach for radio spectrum analysis.
