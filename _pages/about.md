<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Senior c Shandong University, based in Qingdao.

I am now working on Text-to-Motion generation, Multimodal reasoning and generation research. If you would like to have an academic discussion or cooperation, please feel free to email me at chatoncws@gmail.com.

My research interests include:

- Text-to-Motion Generation
- Multimodal reasoning and generation

- **We are  the first work to discover the instability issue in text-to-motion models**
- We successfully strike a balance between accuracy and stability, ensuring our model maintains high precision even in the face of perturbations
- Our work points to a novel direction for improving text-tomotion models, paving the way for the development of more robust models for real-world applications
